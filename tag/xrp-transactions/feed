<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ripple vs. Conventional Banking Transfers: A Discrepancy in Pace</h3>



<p>You may notice a significant difference in pace when comparing Ripple&#8217;s speed in the competitive landscape to conventional banking transfers. Ripple&#8217;s blockchain technology enables near-instantaneous transactions, making it a compelling alternative to traditional banking methods. To highlight this discrepancy in pace, let&#8217;s compare the speed of Ripple transfers with conventional banking transfers in a table below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Ripple</th><th>Other Cryptocurrencies</th><th>Conventional Banking</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Near-instantaneous</td><td>Varies (e.g., Bitcoin: 10 minutes)</td><td>1-5 business days</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As shown in the table, Ripple offers a substantial advantage over both other cryptocurrencies and conventional banking transfers. While other cryptocurrencies may have faster speeds than conventional banking, Ripple&#8217;s near-instantaneous transactions set it apart from the competition. This speed advantage makes Ripple an attractive option for individuals and businesses seeking efficient and quick transactions.</p>
