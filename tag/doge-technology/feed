<p>You might not be aware that Dogecoin, often seen as a mere meme coin, has underpinnings that are as complex and technologically sophisticated as its more serious cryptocurrency counterparts.</p>



<p>Originating as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) quickly evolved beyond its satirical beginnings, leveraging the same underlying blockchain technology that powers the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
