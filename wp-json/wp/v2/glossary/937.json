It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and the primary method of communication between web servers and clients. In the context of Web3 development, HTTP can be used as a communication protocol between a Web3 client and a Web3 provider.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Web3 client can send HTTP requests to the provider to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. These requests can include reading data from the blockchain, submitting transactions, and executing smart contracts. HTTP requests are typically sent using RESTful APIs, which provide a standard way of structuring the requests and responses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RESTful APIs are widely used in Web3 development, and there are several popular Web3 provider APIs that use HTTP, such as Infura, Alchemy, and QuickNode. One of the advantages of using HTTP in Web3 development is that it is a well-established protocol that is widely supported by Web3 providers and clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, HTTP has some limitations, such as its lack of real-time capabilities and its susceptibility to certain security threats. As a result, some developers prefer to use other protocols such as WebSockets or IPC for certain types of Web3 applications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[33],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/937"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=937"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=937"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=937"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=937"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
