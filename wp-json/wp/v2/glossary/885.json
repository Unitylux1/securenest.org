Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions occur directly between users, without the need for an intermediary or middleman.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows for faster and cheaper payments with no need to trust a third party. The Bitcoin network is maintained by a community of users called miners. Miners are incentivized to secure the network by receiving transaction fees for processing blocks of verified transactions into the blockchain (the Bitcoin ledger) and also by earning a reward of newly issued Bitcoins for verifying every block.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to ensure the integrity and security of the Bitcoin blockchain, miners compete on specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical problems. This competition keeps the system decentralized and secure. The Bitcoin protocol is designed to facilitate a secure and efficient transaction system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All transactions are cryptographically signed and stored in publicly visible blocks, which are broadcasted to all Bitcoin nodes on the network. This makes the system transparent and allows users to track the status of their transactions and move funds between nodes quickly and efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since all transactions are recorded in a public ledger, it&#8217;s also impossible for a user or third party to double spend Bitcoins or forge false transactions. As a result, the Bitcoin network is highly secure and reliable, with numerous applications in finance, retail, and other industries.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[27],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/885"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=885"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=885"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=885"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=885"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
