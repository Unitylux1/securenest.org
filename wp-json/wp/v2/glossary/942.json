It is a measure of the amount of computing power being used to mine cryptocurrency blocks, with a higher hash rate meaning more blocks are being mined at a faster rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A higher hash rate can also mean that more people are mining a given cryptocurrency, as well as that the difficulty of finding a given block is higher. Hash rate is represented as hashes per second (H\/s), kilohashes per second (KH\/s), megahashes per second (MH\/s) and terahashes per second (TH\/s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hash rate can also be used to estimate the level of difficulty associated with mining a given cryptocurrency. For example, the higher the hash rate, the higher the difficulty associated with mining a given block. Hash rate is an important factor to consider when deciding whether or not to mine any given cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a given cryptocurrency has a very high hash rate relative to its total market capitalization, it might be too difficult to make a profit when mining it by yourself. However, if it has a relatively low hash rate relative to its total market capitalization, it might be much more profitable to mine it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[33],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/942"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=942"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=942"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=942"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=942"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
