In a Proof-of-Work system, participants compete against each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to approve transactions or blocks in the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, Proof-of-Work is an essential protocol for the secure operation of distributed ledgers. Proof-of-Work systems require that miners use their computing power to solve mathematical puzzles in order to approve transactions and blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These mathematical problems are designed to be difficult to solve, but easy to verify in order to prevent fraud. Once a miner has solved the puzzle, they are rewarded with a reward, usually in the form of cryptocurrency tokens. As each puzzle must be solved individually, this process results in a large amount of computing power being used to maintain network security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to providing security, Proof-of-Work also protects against censorship since miners must expend energy in order to approve transactions and blocks. If a miner is prevented from solving the puzzle by an outside force, they will not be able to receive any rewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes Proof-of-Work ideally suited for distributed systems that need to be secure and resilient against attack while also offering incentives for users who offer their computing power to the network.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[41],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1008"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1008"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1008"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1008"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1008"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
