Authenticity is an assurance that a digital asset is real and genuine. It\u2019s like a digital signature of sorts that shows that the NFT is legitimate. When it comes to authenticity, it is essential to have an immutable blockchain ledger to keep track of the ownership of its assets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will provide a secure and verifiable trail of ownership for those who buy and transfer digital assets. Authenticity in the world of crypto is enforced by smart contracts and the transaction history. Smart contracts are computer programs that record transactions and facilitate authentication of ownership between two parties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This enables buyers to know that they are getting a real digital asset and not a copy or a copycat. Smart contracts also help ensure that any digital asset transferred remains real. Finally, when it comes to authenticity, there is the need to have cryptographically signed certificates that validate all the relevant parties in a transaction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are needed when buying an NFT or trading crypto, as they guarantee that a purchase is done using a reliable source. Additionally, they help ensure that a digital asset is transferred securely. With authenticity being such an important factor in NFTs, having these certifications of ownership and security are invaluable for buyers and sellers alike.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[26],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/855"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=855"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=855"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=855"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=855"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
