It is an automated system that uses blockchain technology to function.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DAOs are designed to facilitate decision making and enable the distribution of resources or tasks among multiple stakeholders in a transparent and accountable manner. A DAO is essentially a set of rules written in code that define how its members interact and behave.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DAOs are powered by Incentivized Automated Agents (IAAs), which are autonomous software that are programmed to reward or punish its members depending on whether they fulfill their duties as dictated by the DAO&#8217;s code. These IAAs help to ensure that the members follow the rules set by the DAO, thus eliminating the need for any central authority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main goals of a DAO is to reduce reliance on third parties and enable greater levels of decentralization. By authorizing transactions through cryptographic algorithms, DAOs also provide greater levels of security and privacy. This can make them ideal for managing digital assets such as tokens, digital rights, and other digital documents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DAOs are still relatively new and are constantly being refined, but they have huge potential for a variety of different applications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[29],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/908"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=908"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=908"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=908"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=908"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
