This address is where cryptocurrency can be sent to and from and simply serves as an identifier for a particular user in the blockchain network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All cryptocurrency wallets come with a wallet address, which can be shared publicly on webpages or other digital platforms. Generally, these wallet addresses are 34-62 characters long, with both uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. The wallet address is created using a cryptographic hashing algorithm known as Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This algorithm creates a unique code that is used to identify an individual user in the network. When cryptocurrency is sent to another user&#8217;s wallet address, it creates a transaction, which is stored on the public ledger. The transaction data will contain user information, amount of currency sent and the date and time of transfer \u2013 all of which are part of the blockchain network\u2019s immutable record of transactions (or the \u201cblockchain\u201d).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that, while users can send cryptocurrency to anyone with a wallet address, they cannot access the sender\u2019s personal information or funds at any point in the process. The transaction will show up on the blockchain network\u2019s public ledger as a completed transfer between two wallet addresses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This data is then verified by miners, who add the transaction to a newly formed block of other transactions and cryptographically hash it into the blockchain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[26],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/854"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=854"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=854"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=854"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=854"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
