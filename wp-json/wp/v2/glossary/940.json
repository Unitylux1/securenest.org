The output of a hash function is referred to as a &#8220;hash value&#8221; or &#8220;message digest&#8221;, and is typically expressed as a hexadecimal number.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hashes are commonly used in cryptography and data integrity to ensure that the data received from a source was not modified during transmission. When it comes to hashing, there are a variety of popular algorithms that are used to produce a hash, including SHA-1 and SHA-2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these algorithms have their own unique features and strengths. SHA-1 and SHA-2 are both considered &#8220;secure&#8221; algorithms and are commonly used for digital signature algorithms and password storage. Hashes are also used in data structures such as dictionaries, associative arrays, and hash tables to index and store data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using a hash value, data can be quickly retrieved by looking up the corresponding hash value instead of searching through the entire data set. This improves performance and reduces the search time. Furthermore, hashes can be used to detect duplicates in data sets by comparing the hashes of two data sets instead of comparing the data itself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[33],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/940"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=940"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
