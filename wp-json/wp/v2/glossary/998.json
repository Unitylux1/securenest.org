It was created to address privacy and scalability issues with the original P2SH address format. P2WSH provides a way to securely store and transact with large amounts of data in a much more efficient manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is achieved by using a new data structure called a &#8220;Witness Script&#8221;. A Witness Script is essentially a script, or program, that is used to validate bitcoin transactions. It defines a set of conditions that must be met for a transaction to be considered valid. These conditions are usually used for signature verification and checking for any restrictions imposed on how the coins can be transferred.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most notable features of P2WSH is that it can provide a much more secure environment for storing and sending large amounts of data in a single transaction. This is because all data that is being sent is encrypted and stored in the Witness Script.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that only people who possess the correct private key can access the data that is being sent. In conclusion, Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash is a new and improved feature on the Bitcoin protocol, providing users with much more secure and efficient ways of sending and storing large amounts of data on the Bitcoin network.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[41],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/998"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=998"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=998"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=998"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=998"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
