It allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a central authority or intermediary. In a DEX, trades are executed directly between the users, without any third party holding custody of their funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach allows for greater security, privacy, and censorship resistance, as well as eliminating the risks associated with centralized exchanges, such as hacking and theft. The key feature of a DEX is that it operates on a blockchain, which is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records all transactions and balances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each user has their own private key, which they use to sign and verify transactions, and no one can alter the blockchain without the consensus of the network. This ensures that trades are executed securely and transparently, without the need for a central clearinghouse or settlement system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decentralized exchange is a new type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for a central authority.
