In a blockchain, a UTXO represents a specific amount of cryptocurrency that has been assigned to a particular address and has not yet been spent. When a cryptocurrency transaction occurs, the funds being sent are essentially the unspent UTXOs of the sender, and the recipient is assigned a new UTXO with the value of the transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand UTXOs better, let&#8217;s consider how a typical transaction works in a blockchain. When a user wants to send some cryptocurrency, they create a transaction that specifies the recipient&#8217;s address and the amount to be sent. The transaction then goes through a process called mining, where it is verified and added to the blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the process, the blockchain network verifies that the sender has sufficient unspent UTXOs to cover the transaction amount, and then marks those UTXOs as &#8220;spent.&#8221; The remaining unspent UTXOs, if any, are returned to the sender as &#8220;change&#8221; in a new UTXO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system of UTXOs ensures that there is no double-spending of cryptocurrency, as each UTXO can only be used once in a transaction. It also provides a level of anonymity for users, as UTXOs are not tied to specific user accounts but rather to unique addresses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UTXOs can also be used for more complex transactions, such as multi-signature transactions, where multiple parties must sign off on a transaction before it can be completed. Overall, UTXOs are a fundamental building block of blockchain technology and enable the secure and decentralized transfer of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding UTXOs is essential for anyone interested in blockchain development, as they are a critical part of designing and implementing secure and efficient blockchain systems.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[46],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1063"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1063"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1063"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1063"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1063"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
