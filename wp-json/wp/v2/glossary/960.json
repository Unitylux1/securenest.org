Traditionally, when an NFT is minted, it is created on the blockchain immediately with a unique ID and metadata.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with lazy minting, the NFT is only created once a buyer purchases it. This means that until a buyer makes a purchase, the NFT doesn&#8217;t exist on the blockchain. This has several advantages for NFT creators. It allows them to save on gas fees, as they only have to pay the fees for minting an NFT when it is sold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that they can make changes to the NFT&#8217;s metadata or properties up until the point that it is sold, which gives them more flexibility and control over their creations. However, there are also some potential downsides to lazy minting. It can make it harder for buyers to verify the authenticity of an NFT, as they can&#8217;t see it on the blockchain until after they purchase it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that the creator could potentially sell the same NFT to multiple buyers, which could lead to disputes and legal issues. Overall, lazy minting is an interesting development in the world of NFTs that offers both benefits and challenges for creators and buyers alike.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[37],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/960"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=960"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=960"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=960"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=960"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
