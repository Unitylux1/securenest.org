The identity of Nakamoto has yet to be uncovered and remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries. His presence was only known through his publication of Bitcoin\u2019s white paper and various online postings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He mined the first bitcoins in the genesis block shortly after the announcement of Bitcoin and continued to be actively involved in the project up to the end of 2010, when he disappeared from public life. Up until now, no one has been able to identify who Nakamoto is, though several theories have been proposed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some believe that he is a collective or a group of people instead of a solitary individual, whereas some suspect he could be a highly renowned cryptography expert. It is not clear whether he is either a real person or an online persona. He could be every person or group of persons but no one can clearly answer this question as he has managed to keep his work hidden from the public.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we know is that Satoshi Nakamoto is the brain behind the birth of Bitcoin and an inspiration to many in the cryptographic space.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[44],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1031"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1031"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1031"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1031"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1031"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
