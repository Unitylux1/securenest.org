These addresses can be used to receive transfers of Bitcoin (BTC) or other tokens and assets. This address is a base58 string derived mathematically from either a public or private key, and it must always be kept secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Bitcoin script address consists of two components, a &#8220;prefix&#8221; and a &#8220;checksum&#8221;. The prefix is the first few characters in the address, and it denotes the type of address being used. For example, the prefix &#8220;1&#8221; indicates that the address is a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) address, and &#8220;3&#8221; indicates a script address, or Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The checksum is a string of letters and numerals at the end of the address and acts as an integrity check to verify whether an address is valid or not. If the checksum of an address does not match the one calculated using the hash of the address, then the address is deemed to be invalid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin script addresses are used to track ownership and exchange data on the Bitcoin network. They provide a way for users to securely move and store value without needing a third party to act as an intermediary. Bitcoin script addresses have several advantages over traditional payment systems, including low transaction fees, full transparency, and quick transactions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[44],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1034"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1034"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1034"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1034"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1034"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
