NFTs are digital assets that are verified and tracked on a blockchain, similar to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These collections can be used for many different purposes, from collecting art and rare items to investing in digital assets for profit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An NFT collection consists of a group of NFTs that are held and managed on a specific platform, such as Mintbase or Rarible. Each NFT within an NFT collection is unique and can represent anything from artworks and videos to trading cards, virtual tickets, and physical goods.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NFTs within an NFT collection can be bought, sold, or exchanged with other users on the platform, just like physical goods. An NFT collection may also include certain \u201ccurated\u201d items that have been created and collected by a specific artist or organization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the collectibles are generally more scarce and more sought after because of their status as being part of a special, curated collection. NFT collections are becoming increasingly popular among collectors around the world, as they provide an easy way to diversify one&#8217;s portfolio across multiple digital assets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond just diversification benefits, NFT collections also offer the potential for high returns as people continue to invest in digital assets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[39],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/983"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=983"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=983"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=983"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=983"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
