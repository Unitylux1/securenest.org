It is an ever-evolving, decentralized system with no central authority that enables users to send and receive value (Bitcoin) in a secure and transparent manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol is an open, public ledger that records all bitcoin transactions, allowing anyone to trace transactions between addresses. The protocol regulates the generation of new bitcoins and enforces consensus among different users in a distributed network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is composed of both protocol rules and operations that occur on the Bitcoin network. All Bitcoin transactions must adhere to these rules, otherwise the transaction will be considered invalid by the network. The protocol determines the cost of Bitcoin transactions, incentivizes miners to confirm transactions, and establishes rules around mining rewards.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also determines how data is propagated across the network, the chronological order of blocks, and the conditions for double-spending on the network. The protocol also ensures that all nodes in the network can quickly and reliably reach consensus about new blocks. The Bitcoin protocol is designed with two main goals in mind: decentralization and user autonomy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This revolutionary system has enabled a global, decentralized economy where individuals have control over their own money, as well as their data. By running on a peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin provides users with unprecedented access to their finances, granting them independence and freedom from third-party institutions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[27],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/886"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=886"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=886"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=886"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=886"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
