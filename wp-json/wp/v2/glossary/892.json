It was first proposed in 1982 by Leslie Lamport, Robert Shostak, and Marshall Pease. This problem is often used to illustrate the concept of fault tolerance in distributed\/decentralized systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, the Byzantine Generals Problem attempts to answer the question: \u2018How can a consensus be reached in a system with unreliable components?\u2019 According to the problem, there are multiple generals each with the same goal of attacking enemies but the generals do not trust each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it may be possible for enemies to intercept or forge communication, so the generals cannot be sure that their communication is reliable. The specific problem that this scenario presents is determining how multiple independent generals can coordinate an attack without getting into an infinite loop of false communications or being tricked by fake messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this problem, the model must rely on two principles: consensus and fault tolerance. Consensus means that any decision must have the majority of the generals agreeing on it before it&#8217;s implemented. Fault tolerance means that the system must remain functioning even with individual generals making errors, lying, or sending out invalid messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This requires reliable communication protocols that can detect errors or inconsistencies in data. By utilizing these two principles, distributed systems can develop consensus mechanisms that allow them to reach agreement even in unreliable network environments with potentially malicious actors present.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has important applications in modern computing infrastructure such as cryptocurrency networks and large-scale distributed ledgers. The Byzantine Generals Problem is an essential tool for understanding how distributed networks function and create solutions to these types of coordination challenges.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[27],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/892"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=892"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=892"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=892"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=892"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
