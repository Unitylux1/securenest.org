This means that the user does not have direct access to their own funds, and therefore must rely on the custodial service to carry out transactions on their behalf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custodial wallets offer users several advantages, such as ease of use, strong security, and insurance in the event of theft. This is because the third party managing the wallet is typically a reputable financial institution with strong cybersecurity measures in place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, these institutions typically provide users with some level of insurance in the event their funds are stolen. On the downside, custodial wallets can come with higher fees, as well as fewer customization options when compared to non-custodial wallets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, when users store their funds with a third party, they are relinquishing direct control of their assets, potentially giving up privacy and leaving them open to third party interference or manipulation. Custodial wallets further hold the private keys of their users meaning that they have control over the user\u2019s funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, custodial wallets are a great option for those who want easy access to their crypto funds without having to concern themselves with security or technical details. However, for those who want more control and customization over their wallet, a non-custodial wallet may be a better choice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[28],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/907"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=907"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=907"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=907"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=907"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
