It is an immutable, distributed ledger that records and stores information about all the transactions that happen in the network, including details like the sender and receiver of funds, the amount transferred, and the time of the transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, blockchain transaction history is a decentralized digital record keeping system. It is built on cryptography, which makes it resistant to fraud and manipulation. The consensus or shared agreement between various parts of the network help to ensure accuracy and consistency of the data stored in it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ledger is encrypted and time-stamped, providing an additional layer of security. In a blockchain transaction history, each entry is assigned a unique identifier that allows for easy tracking. This identifier also ensures that no two entries can ever be confused or mixed up with each other.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The immutable nature of the ledger makes it impossible for anyone to tamper with its contents. Blockchain transaction histories are public and cannot be modified. All network participants can view the records and verify their accuracy. This helps to create a secure foundation that enables different consensus protocols to be applied in different ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, using a distributed consensus protocol, the blockchain transaction history is spread among all its users, removing control from any one individual or entity. This decentralization helps to ensure that the data remains safe, secure, and reliable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[45],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1058"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1058"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1058"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1058"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1058"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
