It was created to provide a way to transfer money without the need for banks or middlemen. Bitcoin transactions are secured through a complex network of computers referred to as nodes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All nodes communicate with each other to create a public ledger called the blockchain, which records every transaction that takes place using bitcoin. The Bitcoin Liquid Network (BLN) is a new scaling solution proposed by blockchain development company Blockstream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BLN is an innovative second layer solution that adds an extra layer of security and usability to the Bitcoin blockchain. BLN works by using a Liquid sidechain, which allows users to move their bitcoins off the main blockchain to securely transact in a private, trustless, and permissionless manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sidechain allows for faster and cheaper transactions as well, further increasing the usability of Bitcoin as a global currency. BLN is a powerful tool for bitcoin users looking for enhanced privacy, scalability, and security, as well as investors seeking liquidity solutions within the cryptocurrency space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its unique design and feature set, the Bitcoin Liquid Network is one of the most promising scaling solutions for Bitcoin currently available.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[37],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/964"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=964"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=964"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=964"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=964"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
