Typically, public keys are represented as a pair of coordinates on an elliptic curve. There are two common representations of elliptic curve public keys: compressed and uncompressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An uncompressed public key consists of two coordinates (x,y) that describe a point on the elliptic curve. This representation is called &#8220;uncompressed&#8221; because it includes the full coordinates of the point, which requires more storage and transmission space. On the other hand, a compressed public key only includes the x-coordinate and a single bit that indicates whether the y-coordinate is even or odd.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This representation is called &#8220;compressed&#8221; because it takes up less storage and transmission space. Although a compressed public key is more space-efficient, generating it requires additional computation, which may result in slightly slower key generation than an uncompressed public key.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, both compressed and uncompressed public keys are equally secure, and the choice between them depends on the specific context and the tradeoff between space and computational efficiency.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[41],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1012"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1012"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1012"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1012"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1012"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
