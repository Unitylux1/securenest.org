NFTs are unique digital assets with inherent scarcity, value and authenticity that are recorded on the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of NFTs include rare digital artwork, sports trading cards, event tickets, and gaming items. NFT marketplaces provide users with a secure and transparent platform for buying and selling NFTs. They serve as the intermediary between buyers and sellers, allowing for easy transactions between two parties who may not know of each other prior to using the marketplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the marketplace, users can browse various categories such as digital art, gaming items, and sports cards, as well as view recent activity and all available items. Additionally, NFT marketplaces often offer an integrated wallet which allows users to store their tokens and track their NFT portfolios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NFT marketplaces give users the opportunity to trade in unique digital assets of value that wouldn\u2019t be possible in the physical world. These digital assets can have a range of different values depending on their relative scarcity and potential collectibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NFT marketplaces provide users with access to a vibrant marketplace of rare digital assets and give them the ability to discover new and exciting opportunities while safely buying and trading in some of the most sought-after items on the web today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[39],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/985"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=985"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=985"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=985"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=985"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
