It is the highest governing power within its jurisdiction, usually represented by a government or a group of people with the power to act on behalf of the state.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has the power to make, sustain and repeal laws, and to enforce them as it deems fit. At the most basic level, central authority acts as the final decision-maker when it comes to issues of safety, security and public policy. For example, the police force, government agencies and military are all under the control of the central authority.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A central authority can also be a religious body or set of laws which are responsible for providing guidelines for the general population. Central authority also has the responsibility to provide stability in a given nation or region. It does this by making sure that civil unrest and violence are kept to a minimum, and that all citizens are treated equally under the law.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central authority also provides services such as transportation, education and healthcare that ensure people have the resources they need to lead a happy, prosperous life. Central authority&#8217;s presence is invaluable in ensuring that a nation functions smoothly and efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without it, a nation would become divided into warring factions, which can lead to widespread poverty, famine and social disorder. By establishing clear rules and providing services, central authorities help to guarantee that people have access to the basic necessities of life and can live in relative peace and security.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[28],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/895"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=895"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=895"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=895"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=895"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
