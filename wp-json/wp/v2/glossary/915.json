It is the reverse operation of encryption, which is the process of encoding data with a special code to make it unreadable to unauthorized users. Decryption involves taking data that has been encrypted, or scrambled, and translating it back into its original form so that it can be easily read and understood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decryption can be achieved through the use of various methods, such as symmetric-key decryption, which requires the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data, or public-key decryption, which requires different keys for encryption and decryption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decryption is often used in combination with encryption to achieve strong information security; when used together, the two provide a secure way to transfer data over networks. Decryption is used in various applications, including secure communications, digital signatures, digital certificates, and payment systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also used to protect and confidentially store sensitive data, and to securely transmit private information over a network. Decryption can also be used to protect data from unauthorized access and prevent data loss and tampering. Additionally, decryption can ensure data integrity, as it allows users to verify that data has not been changed or corrupted in transit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[29],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/915"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=915"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=915"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=915"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=915"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
