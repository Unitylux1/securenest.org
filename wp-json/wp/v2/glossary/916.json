It is designed to ensure that the data has not been altered in transit and that it came from the sender it claims to have come from. Digital signatures are based on cryptography, which is the science of encoding and decoding information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptographic algorithms are used to generate a unique code or pattern, which is known as a digital signature. Digital signatures are typically composed of a combination of public and private keys. Public keys are publicly available information that anyone can access, such as an individual&#8217;s name or email address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private keys, on the other hand, are kept secret and known only to the person who has access to the key. When two parties are exchanging data, one party will generate a digital signature using both the public and private keys. The digital signature is then sent along with the data to the other party, which can validate the signature using the public key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the signature is valid, it shows that the data hasn&#8217;t been altered in transit and can therefore be trusted as having come from the intended source. Digital signatures provide a number of benefits over traditional paper-based signatures. They are more secure and less prone to fraud, since they are unique and can&#8217;t be manipulated or counterfeited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also faster to generate than paper signatures. Additionally, they can be used to sign agreements or documents online, eliminating the need for mailing documents back and forth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[29],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/916"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=916"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=916"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=916"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=916"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
