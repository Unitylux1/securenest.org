It is a 64-character hexadecimal string that serves as a digital fingerprint for a particular transaction, allowing users to easily identify and track the status of their transactions on the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user initiates a transaction on the Ethereum network, the transaction data is broadcasted to the network and picked up by the nodes, who are responsible for processing and validating the transaction. Once a node includes the transaction in a block, they generate a block hash, which serves as the unique identifier for that particular block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The txn hash is then generated by hashing the transaction data along with the block hash, which creates a unique identifier that is specific to that particular transaction and block. The txn hash is included in the block header, which serves as a permanent record of the transaction on the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The txn hash is important for several reasons. Firstly, it allows users to easily track the status of their transactions on the blockchain. This provides users with a high level of transparency and accountability, as they can verify that their transactions have been processed correctly and are recorded on the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the txn hash is important for developers and dApp creators, as it allows them to build complex smart contracts and dApps that rely on the execution of multiple transactions. By referencing the txn hash in their code, developers can create complex workflows and conditional statements that depend on the successful completion of specific transactions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[45],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1047"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1047"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1047"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1047"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1047"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
