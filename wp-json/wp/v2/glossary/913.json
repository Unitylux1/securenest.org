When an organization adopts decentralization, the control over various elements shifts from a high-level instance down to a lower hierarchical level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this level more individuals are included in the process which distributes control over resources and decision-making.The primary benefit of decentralization is to increase expertise and equality among individuals who can make decisions. People who are close to the operational side of a business can get more accurate information and therefore make better informed decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also encourages diversity and opinions which often leads to increased creativity. In terms of cryptocurrencies the participants in the network step in the place of a bank. Instead of relying on a central institution which can control the entire system the individual participants can control their own part of this network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives them freedom to do whatever they want, provided they follow the rules. Disadvantages could be that this system can get inefficient as decision-making can lead to a longer process because of the amount of participants.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[29],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/913"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=913"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=913"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=913"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=913"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
