This allows them to prevent new transactions from being confirmed, double-spend coins, and stop other miners from being rewarded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of a 51% attack is to gain control of the blockchain and perform malicious activities that would not be possible with a smaller proportion of the network&#8217;s computing power. This could include double-spending coins, changing the record of past transactions, or preventing other users from completing valid transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The threat of a 51% attack is one of the main challenges for blockchain networks. As decentralized networks rely on consensus for security and trust, if an attacker controls more than 50% of the network\u2019s hashrate, they can effectively manipulate the network and disrupt its security and functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 51% attack usually requires an attacker to acquire a large amount of computing power and resources to overpower the network. As mining new coins can be very expensive, an attacker\u2019s goal is usually to double-spend coins that have already been spent, preventing them from reaching their intended recipient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, due to the distributed nature of most blockchain protocols, it is extremely difficult to perform a 51% attack. As the computing power of the network grows, it becomes increasingly expensive to acquire enough hashrate to overpower the network.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[25],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1082"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1082"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1082"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1082"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1082"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
