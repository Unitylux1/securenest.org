It refers to the results of intellectual activities in the industrial, scientific, literary and artistic fields. This includes copyrights (music, drawings, books), trademarks (brands, slogans), patents (inventions) and trade secrets (formulas and processes).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, intellectual property involves the protection of unique ideas, inventions, and processes. Intellectual property protection is based on the premise that creative works serve as a form of property, like physical objects. As such, intellectual property has economic value and can be bought and sold in the same way that physical property can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows creators to monetize their works, which means that others can&#8217;t use them without permission or proper compensation. It also prevents patents or other rights from being replicated without permission or payment to the original holder. Intellectual property offers both authors and users certain legal rights and responsibilities when it comes to the use and protection of creative works.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These protections enable authors to express themselves without fear of having their work misused or undercut by those wanting to exploit it for commercial gain. Ultimately, intellectual property protection helps ensure that creators are rewarded for their creative efforts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[34],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/954"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=954"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=954"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=954"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=954"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
