In essence, it describes how difficult it is to find a block in a miner\u2019s given block interval time. This difficulty and miner\u2019s profitability depend on the current hashrate and required difficulty level of the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty level is determined by the collective network hashing power, which refers to the total number of miners that are contributing to the network\u2019s overall hashrate at any given time. The more miners that are actively competing to find new blocks on the network, the higher the overall network hashrate will be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the difficulty is adjusted accordingly so that it takes that same amount of time \u2013 which is referred to as a block interval \u2013 to find each subsequent block. With easier block intervals (and thus, less difficulty) to mine, it can often become overcrowded with miners competing against each other, leading to lower profitability all across the board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare this to the difficult intervals (and higher difficulty levels) that render mining almost impossible for a single miner alone or for those with low-end mining gear. So in order for miners to find success in their endeavors, it\u2019s important to accurately gauge and adjust for the network\u2019s normal block interval and current difficulty levels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[38],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/975"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=975"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=975"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=975"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=975"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
