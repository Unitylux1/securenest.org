It works by using a public key, which is accessible to anyone, and a private key, which is only known by the person authorizing the various transactions. RSA stands for \u201cRivest-Shamir-Adleman\u201d, who were the three cryptographers that developed the algorithm in 1977.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RSA works by encrypting and decrypting data. The process starts with a sender putting their information out into the world. This data is then intercepted by a receiver who holds the secret key or decryption code. Through a specific method of multiplication and modulo operations, the receiver is able to decode the sender\u2019s message and understand what was being communicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The security of RSA comes from the use of two different keys, which are typically very long strings of numbers and can take a significant amount of time and computing power to unlock. It also utilizes prime numbers which further adds to the difficulty of cracking the code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RSA encryption is widely used in both commercial and military applications, and is seen as one of the most secure means of communication available today. In addition to providing secure communication, RSA can also be used for authentication purposes and digital signatures. This makes it an important tool for many areas of cyber security.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[43],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1017"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1017"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1017"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1017"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1017"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
