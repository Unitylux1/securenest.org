This includes both transactions and their associated blocks. A blockchain explorer is like a search engine specifically designed to explore the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be used to view detailed transaction history, view the status of any address, view current unconfirmed transaction pools, and more. In addition to exploring the blockchain data, some explorers also provide other functions such as token distribution or network mining stats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blockchain explorer is essential for any cryptocurrency enthusiast allowing them greater clarity and insight into the activities of the blockchain network. Blockchain explorers are particularly useful when verifying transactions. By checking the transaction data through a blockchain explorer, users can ensure that their transaction was actually confirmed on the blockchain, and can then use the data to track its progress throughout the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, blockchain explorers are also useful for tracing the origin of transactions and for finding patterns in the cryptocurrency economy. By using a blockchain explorer, users can uncover data about particular transactions and addresses and can use this data to gain insight into the behavior of traders, exchanges, and other entities on the blockchain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[27],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/890"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=890"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=890"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=890"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=890"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
