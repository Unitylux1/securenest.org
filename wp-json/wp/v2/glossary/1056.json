It is measured in hashes per second and is an indication of the amount of effort miners have to exert to generate new blocks of data. It also serves as an indicator of the amount of difficulty associated with finding new blocks, because more total hash rate results in higher difficulty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The total hash rate can be influenced by multiple factors, including the latest technology and hardware advancements. Mining hardware tends to become obsolete over time, so miners must constantly upgrade their equipment in order to stay competitive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, new generations of mining hardware can bring a surge in total hash rate that can significantly reduce mining difficulty and make mining more profitable for miners. Another important factor that affects total hash rate is the number of miners working on a block at any given time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If more miners choose to join in on mining a given block, the total hash rate for that block will increase. This can produce a positive result, as increased competition means faster confirmation of transactions on the blockchain. Finally, it\u2019s important to note that the total hash rate fluctuates over time, as miners come in and upgrade their hardware or as miners transition to other projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to have an accurate idea of mining difficulty, miners must keep track of their individual hash rate as well as the network\u2019s total hash rate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[45],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1056"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1056"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1056"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1056"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1056"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
