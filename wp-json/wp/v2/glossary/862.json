It allows different software components to interact and communicate with each other. An API acts as an intermediary, enabling two applications to talk to each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>APIs are commonly used in web development to enable different software components to interact with each other. For example, a web application may use an API to communicate with a database or to fetch data from an external source. An API defines the methods and data structures that the web application can use to interact with the external system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>APIs are widely used in many industries, including e-commerce, finance, and healthcare. In the context of web3, API providers allow developers to access blockchain data and functions through a set of API endpoints. These endpoints can be called by developers to query blockchain data, submit transactions, and interact with smart contracts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>API providers typically offer a variety of APIs, including REST APIs, WebSocket APIs, and more. By providing a standardized way to access blockchain data and functions, APIs make it easier for developers to build decentralized applications that interact with the blockchain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[26],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/862"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=862"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=862"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=862"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=862"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
