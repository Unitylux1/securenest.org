It is often used in computing and other digital applications. In this system, the base-16 counting system is used, instead of the more common base-10 counting system. Hexadecimal uses the integers 0-9, just like the base 10 counting system we&#8217;re familiar with, but it also includes 6 additional symbols from A-F, which represent the numbers 10-15.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These additional symbols allow for more expressive and complex digital processing. In addition to representing larger numbers, hexadecimal also allows for more efficient ways of writing large numbers and more sophisticated color coding techniques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, the decimal number 255 can be written as FF in hexadecimal. By combining 2 F&#8217;s, the same number can be expressed in a much shorter form. This could be especially useful when writing large numbers or when precision is essential. Additionally, by using hexadecimal numbers, it is possible to accurately code colors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web page color can be designated by combining three of the hexadecimal symbols. This number system has become increasingly popular as digital technologies have evolved, as it offers various advantages over the standard base 10 system. With hexadecimal now being used across a variety of digital applications and platforms, it is an important number system to understand and master.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[33],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/946"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=946"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=946"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=946"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=946"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
