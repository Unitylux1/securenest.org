It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3, 2009, the same day he released the original Bitcoin paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Genesis Block contains the first transaction ever made in the Bitcoin network, in which Nakamoto sent bitcoin to himself as a way of proving he had been publishing the paper since before its launch. The Genesis Block is permanently embedded into the Bitcoin network as a reference point for verifying future transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It serves as a reminder of the date and time Bitcoin officially came into existence, along with all its subsequent transaction records. Since the Genesis Block is always included in any full copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, it&#8217;s the only block in the blockchain that doesn&#8217;t have a predecessor block pointing to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s source code includes instructions that make sure the Genesis Block&#8217;s unique structure is preserved in each node of the network. As such, it&#8217;s impossible to delete or replace without completely rewriting Bitcoin\u2019s source code. This ensures that the origin and history of the entire Bitcoin network is immutable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Genesis Block is often referred to as &#8220;the beginning&#8221; of Bitcoin due to its place at the start of the chain. As a result, it&#8217;s considered by some to be an iconic symbol of Bitcoin&#8217;s capabilities and potential for innovative applications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[32],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/934"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=934"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=934"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=934"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=934"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
