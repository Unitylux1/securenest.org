This hash value can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of data since it is almost impossible for two different inputs to generate the same hash value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SHA-256 was designed by the US National Security Agency (NSA) in 2001 and is part of the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family of algorithms. It is a one-way algorithm that takes an input of any length (up to 2^64 bits) and returns an output of 256 bits. The output of SHA-256 is a unique 32 byte (256 bit) string.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SHA-256 algorithm is structured in such a way that it takes a given input and runs it through a series of round functions that ultimately produce a 256 bit output. This output is resilient to any kind of corruption or distortion of the input data which makes it suitable for use in verifying the integrity of data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SHA-256 is also designed to be resistant to all known cryptanalytic attacks as well as preimage, second preimage, brute-force and collision attacks. This makes SHA-256 a secure hashing algorithm that can be used for transmission, storage and other applications where data integrity needs to be verified.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[44],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1028"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1028"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1028"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1028"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1028"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
