It is based on the secp256k1- defined elliptic curve that was proposed by Certicom Research in 2000. The curve satisfies a set of properties which allow it to be used for digital signatures in a variety of different cryptographic protocols, including Bitcoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secp256k1-defined elliptic curve consists of a finite set of points on a smooth algebraic surface that creates 256-bit private keys and public keys. The shape of the curve dictates how these keys are related, so that any point on the curve can be derived from the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why the curve is said to be an \u201celliptic\u201d one\u2014it creates an additive relationship between the two points on the curve. SECP256K1 is an important component of Bitcoin&#8217;s security protocol, as it ensures that all transactions are verifiable and secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is accomplished by using the secp256k1 elliptic curve to digitally sign every transaction. When someone initiates a transaction, their private key is used to sign the transaction, which creates a digitized signature that can only be generated by someone who has the same private key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This signature is then broadcasted throughout the network and can be used to validate that a particular transaction did indeed originate from the individual who initiated it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[44],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1027"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1027"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1027"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1027"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1027"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
