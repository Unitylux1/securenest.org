In general, it is a platform that allows users to make their crypto transactions more anonymous. It works by mixing different users&#8217; coins and then sending them back to the same users with different addresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helps protect the anonymity of users\u2019 coin transactions and makes it harder to track them. When a user sends coins or cryptos to the mixer, the service creates a pool of all these coins from different users. Then, the mixer takes the coins from this pool and completely randomizes them, so it\u2019s highly unlikely that the same user will get their coins back in the same order or amounts as before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this process is completed, it then sends the coins back to the users with different addresses, taking them out of the original pool. This makes it harder for anyone to trace a transaction back to its original sender. Overall, coin mixers can be helpful for those that want to increase the privacy and security of their transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can help to make people\u2019s online activities more secure, helping to protect their identities and keep their transactions untraceable. Coin mixers are available in many forms, and it is important that users research and understand which ones offer the highest security.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[28],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/899"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=899"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=899"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=899"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=899"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
