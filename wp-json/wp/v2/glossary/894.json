This means that when sending or receiving crypto, it is important to ensure that the address is all lower-case or all upper-case. If not, then the transaction could be sent to the wrong address and become lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case sensitivity will depend on the type of address and the cryptocurrency used. Simply put, letters in a crypto address are not interchangeable regardless of case. For example, the letter &#8216;A&#8217; does not have the same meaning as the letter &#8216;a&#8217; at any point in the address, nor does &#8216;Q&#8217; have the same meaning as &#8216;q&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, crypto addresses must be kept in the same case as they were when they were first created. This does not concern addresses without case sensitivity as they can be written either way. Luckily, most crypto wallets address this problem automatically by using checksums or generating a multi-address prefix that must match exactly regardless of case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This eliminates any potential confusion and makes it clear which address is being used. Even so, it is still important for users to be aware of case sensitivity when dealing with crypto addresses and to always ensure that their payment information is accurate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[28],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/894"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=894"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=894"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=894"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=894"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
