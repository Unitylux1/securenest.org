An NFT is a unique digital asset that is created and stored on a blockchain. Unlike other digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, an NFT cannot be divided up into smaller parts, so each token is completely unique and cannot be replicated or &#8216;forked&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To mint an NFT, you must first create a design for the asset, which can be anything from a piece of artwork, to a song, to a collectible item such as a tokenized stadium seat. The design is then encoded into a smart contract and stored on the blockchain, along with some additional data such as ownership details or artwork quality ratings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is done through a process known as tokenization, which assigns the asset to a given address which then guarantees its ownership. Once an NFT is created, the owner can choose to share it, trade it, or keep it as their own treasured good. Many people view owning an NFT as an investment as it could have value both now and in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more people begin to use them as investments, and more businesses begin to accept them as tokens of value, their influence will only continue to grow and expand.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[38],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/979"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=979"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=979"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=979"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=979"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
