It is also known as a digital fingerprint or hash. The Merkle root is created through a hashing algorithm and serves as a single source that verifies the integrity of the entire block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a blockchain network, each transaction is stored as a string of numbers and letters called a hash, and all the hashes in a block are stored in the Merkle root. The hashes are then organized into what is known as a binary tree. This tree structure is used to efficiently store large amounts of data in a single data structure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the bottom of the structure, each of the hashes is combined with another hash in a process called hashing. This process creates a single value that serves as the Merkle root of the blockchain network. The Merkle root is an important security feature in blockchain networks, as it allows the nodes of the network to check whether a certain transaction has been included in the block or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, it provides an easy way to check if data has been altered or not by verifying the root against what is stored in the block itself. This makes tampering with transactions significantly harder. As such, it provides an important component in ensuring the trustworthiness and security of a blockchain network.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[38],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/969"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=969"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=969"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=969"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=969"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
