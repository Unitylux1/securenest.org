It takes many forms such as video games, virtual reality, augmented reality and other immersive experiences. It&#8217;s vast, connected, and growing at a rapid rate. At its core, Metaverse is a platform that allows people to interact and shape their own virtual world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This world will be populated by virtual objects, avatars, and potentially other physical objects that can be interacted with. People will be able to create, explore, and form relationships in the Metaverse. In the Metaverse, virtual reality allows people to inhabit a space beyond reality, like being in a large game world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This world can dynamically update itself based on data from the real world. It can be used for entertainment, education, business, commerce and more. The major benefit of the Metaverse is that it brings the physical and virtual worlds closer together. For example, people can shop online, have virtual meetings with colleagues around the world, attend lectures or even learn new skills in a virtual environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the power of connected technologies, the possibilities are endless. The Metaverse has been gaining traction as technology continues to evolve and more technologically savvy people are participating in it. It&#8217;s quickly becoming a major part of our digital lives and is expected to continue growing and developing in the near future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[38],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/972"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=972"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=972"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=972"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=972"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
