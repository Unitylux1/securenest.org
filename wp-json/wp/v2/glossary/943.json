It is composed of mining chips, power supplies, and heatsinks, and is responsible for performing calculations related to cryptocurrency mining. Generally, each mining rig contains multiple hashboards which are connected to each other via a circuit board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of the hashboard is to perform the cryptographic calculations required in order to mine cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. Specifically, it\u2019s responsible for hashing numbers and performing other mathematical calculations. The hashboard&#8217;s performance is determined by the number of its boards, its clock frequency, and its thermal capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of a hashboard is a complex one, and can vary from one brand to another. The components consist of large ASIC chips, power supplies, and heatsinks which help to keep the board cool. Each chip is composed of thousands of nuts and bolts that are used to calculate the various hash functions that are necessary for cryptocurrency mining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, a hashboard is an essential component of any cryptocurrency mining setup. They are responsible for performing the calculations needed to mine cryptocurrencies and can greatly improve the performance of the miner if configured correctly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[33],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/943"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=943"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=943"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=943"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=943"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
