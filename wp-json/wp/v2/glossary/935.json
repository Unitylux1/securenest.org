In other words, it is the first NFT minted on a particular platform, and it marks the beginning of that platform&#8217;s history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &#8220;Genesis&#8221; is often used to refer to the creation story in the Bible, and in the context of NFTs, it can be seen as the &#8220;beginning&#8221; or &#8220;origin&#8221; of a particular platform. Genesis NFTs are usually designed to be one-of-a-kind and can have special features or attributes that set them apart from other NFTs on the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key benefits of owning a Genesis NFT is that it can give the owner a sense of exclusivity and status within the platform&#8217;s community. Since the Genesis NFT is the first of its kind, it is often seen as a collector&#8217;s item or a symbol of early adoption. Additionally, Genesis NFTs can have unique properties or bonuses that are not available to other NFTs on the platform, such as additional functionality or special access to certain features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a technical perspective, Genesis NFTs are created using smart contracts on a blockchain. The smart contract defines the rules and properties of the NFT, such as its unique ID, ownership, and any special features or bonuses. Once the smart contract is deployed, the Genesis NFT is minted and added to the blockchain, where it can be bought, sold, and traded like any other NFT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It marks the beginning of the platform&#8217;s history and can have special features or attributes that set it apart from other NFTs on the platform.
