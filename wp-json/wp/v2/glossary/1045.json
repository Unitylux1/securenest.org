This means that the same key is used to encrypt data when it is sent, and to decrypt it when it is received. In order for symmetric encryption to work, both communication parties must have the same encrypted key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This form of encryption is especially useful when both sender and receiver don&#8217;t want anyone else to be able to decrypt the data. Symmetric encryption uses mathematical algorithms, called ciphers, to generate an unbreakable code between two communication parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is encrypted with one key, and then transmitted over the Internet. The recipient of the data will then use the same key to decrypt the data so it can be read. This method of encryption is faster than other types of encryption and requires fewer resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Symmetric encryption has been widely used for decades, however it does have some drawbacks. One is that the same key must be shared between two parties, which creates a potential security risk. Also, if the key is lost or forgotten, the data cannot be recovered without access to the key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these reasons, symmetric encryption has been largely replaced by more secure forms of encryption such as asymmetric encryption, which uses two different keys for encryption and decryption.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[44],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1045"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1045"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1045"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1045"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1045"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
