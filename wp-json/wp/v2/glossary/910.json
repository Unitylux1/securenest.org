It was developed as part of the U.S. Government&#8217;s Capstone project, an initiative started in the mid-90s to develop secure digital signature systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms over finite fields, and provides a means of authenticating a message or other digital asset by attaching a signature to it. DSA essentially refers to the way the algorithm creates a signature by combining the signer&#8217;s private key with the message&#8217;s hash to produce a unique signature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This signature is then verified using the signer&#8217;s public key, which is publicly available. If the signature is valid, it proves that the message was emitted from the signer, and that it hasn&#8217;t been altered since it was signed (known as verification). From a technical standpoint, DSA involves two operations: signing and verifying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When signing, the algorithm combines the signer&#8217;s private key with the message hash to generate a signature. To verify, the algorithm uses the signer&#8217;s public key to decrypt the signature and then compares it to the message&#8217;s hash to ensure that no alteration has occurred since it was signed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, DSA enables secure authentication of digital assets and provides a secure means of confirming that they have not been tampered with since they were signed. It is used in many different applications, including digital certificates and authentication systems.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[29],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/910"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=910"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=910"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=910"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=910"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
