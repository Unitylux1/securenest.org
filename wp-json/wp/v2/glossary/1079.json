Private keys are integral components of cryptocurrency wallets, which are used to store and send digital funds.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without the private key, users cannot access the funds in their wallets. That is why it is important to backup private keys properly so they are secure and can be accessed if the wallet is ever lost or stolen. A 12-Word seed phrase is a sequence of 12 randomly generated words that were created specifically for recovery purposes.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This phrase serves as a seed that can generate the same number of private keys in the same order each time it is used. The seed phrase itself is not a private key, therefore it is not possible for a hacker or malicious user to gain access to the funds stored in a wallet from a 12-word seed phrase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to store the seed phrase in a secure location such as an encrypted file or a password-protected backup device. In addition, it is a good idea to write down the 12-word seed phrase and store it in a location that is both physically and digitally secure, such as a safe deposit box or a vault.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also critical to remember that if the seed phrase is lost or forgotten, the private keys associated with the wallet and its contents could become inaccessible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[25],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1079"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1079"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1079"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1079"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1079"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
