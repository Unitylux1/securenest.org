The hash value is then used to verify that the data has not been altered, which ensures its integrity and protects it from tampering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process is especially useful in situations where it is necessary to quickly and securely store or verify large amounts of data.Hashing works by encoding data into a hash value by running it through an algorithm. The algorithm creates a unique hash value for each piece of data that is input, meaning that if even one character is changed, the resulting hash value will be different from the first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes it difficult for malicious actors to tamper with the data, as any changes would be immediately detectable and traceable.Hashing has many different uses, including providing secure authentication for users, ensuring data integrity, and verifying the accuracy of data and information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s used for cryptographic applications like digital signatures, password storage, and message authentication, as well as payment systems like Bitcoin and other forms of virtual currency. Its use in these and other areas is essential to the secure transmission of information over networks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[33],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/944"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=944"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=944"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=944"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=944"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
