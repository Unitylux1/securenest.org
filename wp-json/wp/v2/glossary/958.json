It was launched in 2017 as an alternative to Ropsten, which was experiencing a high level of spam attacks at the time. Kovan is named after the Kovan Testnet Faucet, which is a tool that provides users with test Ether for use on the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like other test networks, Kovan uses a separate cryptocurrency called &#8220;test Ether&#8221; that has no real-world value. This allows developers and users to test Ethereum applications and smart contracts without risking real funds. One of the advantages of Kovan is that it uses a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a PoA network, a small number of trusted validators are responsible for validating transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain. This makes the network faster and more efficient, since there is no need for complex mathematical computations to be performed in order to validate transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it also means that the network is less decentralized than the main Ethereum network, since there are fewer nodes that can participate in the consensus process. Despite this limitation, Kovan is a valuable tool for Ethereum developers and users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It allows developers to test and debug their smart contracts and applications in a safe and controlled environment, without risking real funds. It also allows users to experiment with Ethereum features and applications without committing real assets or interacting with the main network.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[36],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/958"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=958"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=958"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=958"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=958"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
