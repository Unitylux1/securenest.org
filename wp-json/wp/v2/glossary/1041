It was proposed in mid 2014 by the Ethereum Foundation in order to make it easier to develop efficient and secure distributed applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solidity is a statically typed language, which means that it requires the programmer to specify the data type of each variable before compiling the code. This helps to catch errors and improve the efficiency of the code. Solidity is a Turing complete language, meaning that it can solve any computation problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, it provides an intuitive way to write a smart contract without having to manually generate the code required to execute a transaction on the Ethereum network. Solidity also supports other features such as strong typing, inheritance, library creation and overloading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solidity code is compiled into a bytecode, which is then deployed onto the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is used to execute the compiled code as well as to store data related to it. In addition, it provides Ethereum\u2019s consensus algorithm, which allows for distributed consensus between nodes on the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solidity is becoming increasingly popular among developers because of its simplicity and flexibility. It allows developers to write complex contracts on the Ethereum platform without the need for manual code generation or the need for a detailed understanding of the Ethereum protocol. Solidity\u2019s popularity continues to grow as more developers bring their ideas to life on the blockchain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[44],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1041"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1041"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1041"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1041"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1041"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
