The public key is used to encrypt data and the private key is used to decrypt the data. Asymmetric encryption helps to ensure that data is only accessible to those with the correct private key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The public and private keys are generated and then used together to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key is usually available publicly, whereas the private key is kept secure by only its owner (or, in some cases, a designated custodian). Data can be encrypted with the public key and only decrypted by the party with the corresponding private key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes asymmetric encryption an ideal solution for ensuring secure communication between two or more parties. Additionally, because the public key is publicly available, it allows for efficient verification of authenticity. This makes message authentication even more reliable than using symmetric encryption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to its use in secure communication, asymmetric encryption is also used in digital signatures, the management of secure access tokens, the management of digital certificates, and other operations that require data to remain confidential and only accessible to authorized individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asymmetric encryption can also be used as part of a hybrid approach to encryption, combining both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to provide a well-rounded security solution.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[26],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/871"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=871"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=871"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=871"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=871"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
