This is done in sequential order from the genesis block to the current tip of the blockchain. This is in contrast to the &#8220;headers-first&#8221; approach, where the client first downloads and verifies the block headers, and then downloads the full blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the blocks-first approach, the client begins by downloading the genesis block, and then requests subsequent blocks from a peer. The client verifies each block before requesting the next one, ensuring that the blockchain is valid and that each block contains a valid Proof-of-Work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process continues until the client reaches the current tip of the blockchain. The blocks-first approach is generally slower than the headers-first approach because it involves downloading and verifying the entire block for each block in the blockchain. However, it provides a higher level of security because it verifies the entire block, including all transactions, rather than just the block header.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[27],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/891"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=891"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=891"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=891"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=891"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
