RPC allows clients to issue commands to a Bitcoin node and receive responses from it, without the need for the client and the node to be on the same machine or network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of Bitcoin Core, RPC allows users to interact with the Bitcoin network through the node&#8217;s APIs. For example, a user can use RPC to query the node for information about the blockchain, such as the current block height or transaction details. They can also use RPC to send transactions to the network or to create new Bitcoin addresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use RPC in Bitcoin Core, a user needs to enable it in the node&#8217;s configuration file and specify a username and password for authentication. This helps to ensure that only authorized users can access the node&#8217;s APIs remotely. Overall, RPC in Bitcoin Core is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with the Bitcoin network programmatically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It enables developers to build applications and services that leverage the power of the Bitcoin network, while also providing users with a way to interact with the network directly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[43],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1019"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1019"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1019"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1019"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1019"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
