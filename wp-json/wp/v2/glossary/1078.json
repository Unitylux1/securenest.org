It is generated from a particular deterministic wallet type and contains all of the necessary data required to access funds stored on that wallet.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seed phrase is composed of 24 words randomly generated from a list of 2,048 words, divided into four 6-word segments. Each seed phrase is unique and should be treated with extreme caution, as it can be used to gain control of your wallet and all the funds associated with it.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These types of wallets are often referred to as \u201cbrain wallets\u201d as they rely on secure memorization techniques. It is highly recommended to ensure the security of the seed phrase by writing it down on paper or metal or storing it in an encrypted digital format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important aspect to keep in mind when dealing with 24-word seed phrases is that they should never be shared with anyone, as anyone who gains access to it can gain full control of the wallet and its funds. It is also important to make copies of the seed phrase and store them securely in multiple physical and\/or digital locations, preferably offline.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, many cryptocurrency wallets nowadays offer various methods of verifying the accuracy of your seed phrase such as by using a digital signature or by using an entropy source to generate multiple words at once.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[25],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1078"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1078"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1078"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1078"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1078"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
