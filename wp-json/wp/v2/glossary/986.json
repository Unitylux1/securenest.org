Blockchain networks, such as those used for cryptocurrency transactions, process transactions in blocks. Each block has a maximum size that dictates the amount of data it can store, and this limit can constrain the amount of transactions that the network can process at any given time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the transactions in a block exceed its maximum capacity, the process of verifying and including them in the blockchain slows down or stops altogether. This slowdown is known as network congestion. Blockchain network congestion can be caused by a variety of factors, including an increase in transaction requests and malicious actors attempting to slow down or even completely shut down a blockchain network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In either case, it is a problem because it can significantly affect the speed and efficiency of transactions, preventing them from being completed as quickly or securely as they could otherwise be. One way of managing blockchain network congestion is by adjusting the size of the blocks and increasing their throughput capacity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helps by allowing more transactions to be processed at once, thereby relieving the congestion. Additionally, blockchain networks can introduce transaction fees that incentivize miners to prioritize and process the most important transactions first. Finally, some blockchain networks use algorithms and consensus mechanisms that allow for transaction processing without ever having to increase block sizes, thereby reducing or even eliminating the potential for network congestion.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[39],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/986"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=986"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=986"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=986"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=986"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
