Unlike other consensus algorithms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which rely on resource-intensive computations or token ownership, PoA is based on the reputation and authority of a select group of trusted validators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a PoA consensus algorithm, a group of validators, also known as &#8220;authorities,&#8221; is pre-selected to validate transactions and create new blocks. These authorities are typically known entities with established identities, such as reputable organizations or individuals, and they are granted the right to validate transactions based on their reputation or authority in the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that the consensus is achieved based on the trust placed in these authorities, rather than through competitive mining or staking mechanisms. One of the key advantages of PoA is its efficiency and scalability. Since PoA does not require validators to solve complex computations or stake significant amounts of tokens, it can achieve high transaction throughput and low latency, making it suitable for applications that require fast and efficient transaction processing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important feature of PoA is its robustness against 51% attacks, a type of attack where a single entity or group gains control of more than 50% of the network&#8217;s computational power or token ownership. In PoA, since the authorities are pre-selected and known entities, the chances of a 51% attack are significantly reduced, as it would require a collusion of the majority of the authorities, which is less likely to occur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, PoA also has some limitations. One of the main concerns is the centralization of power in the hands of the selected authorities. Since the consensus is based on the reputation and authority of a limited number of validators, the network&#8217;s decentralization and censorship resistance may be compromised.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[41],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1004"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1004"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1004"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1004"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1004"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
