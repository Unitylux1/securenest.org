Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that seek to maintain a stable price, and USDC is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. USDC has been developed in cooperation between two major technology firms; Circle, a company that acts as a payment and trading platform for digital currencies, and Coinbase, an online platform for buying and selling digital currencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of USDC is to provide a cryptocurrency that is more stable than Bitcoin, but with all the benefits of a digital asset. SinceUSDC is backed by the U.S. dollar, its value is not as volatile as other cryptocurrencies and it can be used by traders, investors and consumers alike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any currency, users have the ability to transfer and store their USDC within supported wallets and exchanges. When it comes to security, USDC uses a similar blockchain infrastructure as Ethereum. This uses an open source protocol called ERC-20 which provides transparency over transactions, as well as allowing users to integrate the currency with other smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, due to its stability and ease of use, USDC has been adopted by a number of large companies and may become more widely used in the near future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","categories":[24],"tags":[],"letters":[46],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary\/1062"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/glossary"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/glossary"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1062"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1062"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1062"},{"taxonomy":"letters","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/letters?post=1062"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
