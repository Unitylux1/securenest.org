NFTs are a part of the entire crypto space using the underlying blockchain technology to <a href=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/learn\/nft-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offer specific features<\/a> which you won\u2019t have with an image or a screenshot.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we will explain what the difference is and why taking a picture of NFTs is not the same as having the real NFT. Screenshotting an NFT can be used for presentation purposes.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you possess NFTs which you would like to sell, you can present a screenshot of your NFTs to buyers instead of sending them the original NFT. This can protect the seller from theft.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the creator allows it, it is legal to screenshot an NFT from an NFT marketplace for personal use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can You Screenshot an NFT and Use It?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you screenshot an NFT, you capture a digital copy of the original piece of art.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This original was minted on the blockchain, giving it a proof of its authenticity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses the same principle as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. There is a unique metadata connected to the NFT as hashes. This data is only <a href=\"https:\/\/online.maryville.edu\/blog\/what-is-a-non-fungible-token\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available to the original NFT and stored in the blockchain<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you try to copy an NFT even with its data, the blockchain could prove that the history of your copy does not match with the history of the original. If you possess a copy, you won\u2019t have the same ownership of the original.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only the owner of the original NFT has the ownership of it. If you take a screenshot, the image file you\u2019ve taken is stored in your photo library as every other image.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the screenshot to show it to others, which can be helpful if you want to sell the original. Instead of sending originals, you can just send a screenshot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Can\u2019t You Screenshot an NFT?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can screenshot an NFT, but you won\u2019t get the original file.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your screenshot is only a copy which doesn\u2019t have any value.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a great way to capture and save information about this digital art, but it won\u2019t break the authenticity of the Non-Fungible Tokens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because NFTs are unique digital assets that have been cryptographically encrypted and their <a href=\"https:\/\/mintable.medium.com\/nfts-why-cant-i-just-take-a-screenshot-ef781d625844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">verification information is stored on the blockchain<\/a>. Every NFT has a unique identifier in the same way cryptocurrencies have.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this identifier, which is created through hashing algorithms, no one can copy or duplicate them. NFTs have unique data which is attached to them, screenshots don\u2019t have this data.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, you can alter screenshots easily but NFTs are not editable. It is the same principle as you can\u2019t change a real painted picture after it is finished. You theoretically could, but this would destroy the original.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unique data of NFTs act as a digital proof of ownership. This proof is stored on the blockchain, which no one can change. If you have the original file, you can prove the authenticity of the data stored on the blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a screenshot, you can\u2019t prove anything, as this is just a regular image file. Compare this to important documents you have, like birth certificates, etc. These types of documents are printed on special paper, have signatures and are stamped.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would make a scan, you would have a copy. But this would clearly be not the original and therefore won\u2019t be able to have the same authenticity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Can You Mint a Screenshot of an NFT?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, you can\u2019t mint a screenshot of an NFT.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theoretically, you could take a screenshot and then create a new NFT from this screenshot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this would violate copyrights of the original creator as you would sell a copy of the real NFT as a new real NFT. Imagine a painter copying Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s picture of the Mona Lisa. This would be a reproduction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If he would sell it and if Leonardo da Vinci would still be alive, he would take legal action against the painter because he uses the copy for commercial purposes. If he would use this copy for his personal usage, then he wouldn\u2019t have any problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same applies if you screenshot something else. If an artist created a picture without knowing what NFTs are, he would have copyrights for his work. Copying other images besides NFTs is also no problem for personal purposes.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you screenshot someone else\u2019s work, you cannot sell it. This would be a commercial purpose and therefore you could be sued for copyright infringement. If you want to sell your own NFT, you would have to create your own picture in order to do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenshotting NFTs is not the problem if the owner of the artwork allows it. But if you want to sell the screenshot from the creator or the NFT, then you can get legal problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be illegal to screenshot an NFT without the permission of the owner and then to sell it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Do People Buy NFTs When You Can Screenshot It?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NFTs have specific features, giving them value.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenshots or images don\u2019t have such value. If you just look at the image, you won\u2019t see the difference.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference lies in the blockchain that gives the NFT specific <a href=\"https:\/\/scholarship.law.uc.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=ipclj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data, which a general image won\u2019t have<\/a>. This data allows us to prove ownership. Image files cannot provide this proof.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can even look at the history of ownership and see who the owners were in the past. This is exactly like with Bitcoin. You can look into the entire transaction history of it. Every NFT can be traced back this way to its origin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The creator can even attach some specific benefits to an NFT. For example, every owner of the NFT could get a special invitation to an event where only people who bought an NFT could take part.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can open an entirely new market for artists, designers and creators of the NFT. This way, they can provide buyers with special perks and make money with it. There are already such benefits used.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One popular example is the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which is a community where everyone gets access to who bought a Bored Ape NFT. The NFT market is new, but in the next few years more applications may arise.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenshots associated with an NFT will provide a significant possibility to share memes, collectibles or even pictures of physical art. Sharing the images only decreases the risk of potential fraud.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another value of an NFT is that it can enhance the customer base of artists. If they take their physical art and put it also behind the NFT, they can use a second market to promote their work. Every person can promote their art or creation on the blockchain.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering both physical and digital products opens new businesses and makes people able to sell through different channels by providing real value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope you have been able to gain valuable insight into what happens if you screenshot an NFT. As we saw, screenshot doesn\u2019t affect the original NFT as you cannot copy the value it provides, proof of ownership.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenshots can help to promote digital artwork across the internet and if you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/nft\/is-a-screenshot-the-same-as-the-original-nft-artwork-2022361202637360206\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">use them for personal stuff<\/a>, then it won\u2019t be a problem. Don\u2019t use these screenshots for commercial purposes as you then break copyright law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">FAQ<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can You Make an NFT From a Screenshot?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it is possible to create a new NFT from a screenshot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From every digital asset, a Non-Fungible Token can be created.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating NFTs is simple. You just take the picture you want to use and upload it onto a platform which provides an NFT marketplace. They have the connection to the blockchain to attach data to your image.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once uploaded, you can set a price as well as all the details you want to include in your token. Once created, it is added to the blockchain. From this point, your NFT has a recorded proof of ownership which will be passed over to the person who will buy it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great way to protect intellectual property and authenticity of digital artwork or content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are NFT Screenshots Detectable?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, in terms of authenticity, they are easily detectable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re questioning if someone finds your screenshot you did it in the past, then it won\u2019t be detectable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people like the images provided by NFTs but instead of buying them, they just want to screenshot it. This is fine for personal use and a screenshot is just an image file. This means that the creator of the original won\u2019t find your image.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine thousands of people all over the world would screenshot the same NFT. It would be impossible to search all the personal hard drives or smartphones to see if they have a screenshot of this NFT.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re questioning if you can pretend you have an NFT buy providing just a screenshot, then it is, of course, detectable. The potential buyer could easily check the authenticity over the blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screenshot won\u2019t have any data recorded on the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Screenshot an NFT?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can take a screenshot just as you normally would do it for regular screenshots.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different ways to display an NFT to screenshot it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can open an NFT marketplace and just search for the NFT you want. It then will open and the image will be displayed to you so you can decide if you want to buy it. Here, you can just screenshot it for your personal collection.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way is to use a blockchain explorer where you can paste in the address of the NFT to see the metadata or transaction history in the blockchain. You can also capture the information on your display.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Can You Screenshot an NFT?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you screenshot an NFT, you capture a digital copy of the original artwork or content, but it does not hold the same value as the actual NFT. NFTs are unique digital assets with specific features enabled by blockchain technology, such as proof of ownership and traceability. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenshotting an NFT can be useful for personal collection or presentation purposes, but it does not provide the same authenticity and ownership rights as the original NFT. While screenshots can be shared and used for promotion, it is important to respect copyright laws and not use them for commercial purposes without permission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It is always recommended to consult a qualified attorney regarding any legal issues you may face.
