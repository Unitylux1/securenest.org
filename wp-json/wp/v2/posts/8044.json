Ethereum, the open-source blockchain platform, has revolutionized the creation and management of digital assets through the use of token standards. Two prominent examples of these standards are ERC-20 and ERC-721.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/learn\/ethereum-erc-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ERC-20 is a token standard<\/a> that allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the Ethereum platform. Fungible tokens are identical and interchangeable, meaning they can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. This standard has been widely adopted and is used for various purposes, including Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and the creation of utility tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/learn\/ethereum-erc-721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ERC-721 is a token standard<\/a> that enables the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike ERC-20 tokens, each ERC-721 token is unique and can&#8217;t be exchanged on a like-for-like basis. NFTs have gained popularity in areas such as digital art, collectibles, and gaming, where uniqueness and ownership are valued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These token standards are implemented through smart contracts, self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. By adhering to these standards, developers ensure interoperability and compatibility between different digital assets, allowing for seamless integration and interaction within the Ethereum ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ERC-20 Tokens: Standardizing Ethereum&#8217;s Fungible Assets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can begin the discussion of ERC-20 tokens by exploring their origins and evolution.
