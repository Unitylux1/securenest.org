class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Introduction<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the exciting world of Web3 apps!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the next generation of the internet takes shape through decentralization and blockchain technology, a surge of innovative applications is emerging, offering enhanced privacy, security, and accessibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From NFT marketplaces to decentralized social networks, these top Web 3.0 you must know apps are revolutionizing how we interact online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, IoT, semantic web or cloud storage, Web 3 could work as the foundation for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding Web3 Apps and Blockchain Technology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web3 apps are the next generation of web applications that use blockchain technology to offer greater decentralization, security, and privacy compared to traditional apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web 3.0 is the newest version of the internet after Web 2.0 and Web 1.0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are Web3 Apps?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Web3 Apps, also known as decentralized applications (dApps), are a new generation of software that runs on blockchains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging the power of this decentralized ecosystem, Web3 apps offer increased transparency, security, and user control compared to traditional web applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One popular example of a Web3 app is OpenSea\u2014a bustling NFT marketplace that allows users to buy, sell and trade digital assets such as artwork and collectibles using cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its foundation built on blockchain technology, OpenSea enables creators to maintain ownership over their work while granting buyers verifiable proof of ownership when they purchase pieces within the marketplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Are They Different From Traditional Apps?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Web3 provides a unique user experience by harnessing the power of blockchain technology and decentralization, making it stand out from traditional Web2 apps in several ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data storage also plays a crucial role in distinguishing these app types.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional applications typically store user information on centralized servers\u2014potentially exposing it to hack or misuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, Web3 apps employ decentralized solutions to store data like distributed ledgers or peer-to-peer (P2P) networks that enhance security and privacy for their users\u2019 data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the Ethereum-based Brave Browser as an example.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike popular browsers such as Chrome or Firefox that record browsing habits for targeted ads revenue generation (centralized authority), Brave upholds user privacy with built-in ad-blockers while rewarding users with cryptocurrency tokens called Basic Attention Tokens (BATs) when they opt into ads voluntarily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a perfect representation of how decentralization can facilitate fairer results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Using Web3 Apps<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Web3 apps are transforming the digital landscape and offer a wide range of benefits, particularly for those who are new to the
