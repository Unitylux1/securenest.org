Childchains, on the other hand, are chains that are directly connected to the main blockchain. They inherit the security and consensus of the main chain while providing the flexibility to process transactions and execute smart contracts independently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heimdall and Bor are two essential components of the Polygon network that ensure high transaction rates and secure operations. Heimdall is responsible for securing the network by validating transactions, preventing double-spending, and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bor, on the other hand, is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible execution environment on the Polygon network.
