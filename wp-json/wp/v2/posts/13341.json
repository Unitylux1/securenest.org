In a cross-chain communication scenario, where transactions are taking place across different blockchains, ensuring transaction finality becomes even more complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this challenge, Cardano utilizes a consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake (PoS) that provides fast and final transaction confirmation. Cardano&#8217;s PoS consensus ensures that once a transaction is included in a block and added to the blockchain, it is considered final and cannot be altered. This mechanism enhances the security and integrity of transactions across multiple blockchains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate the concept of transaction finality across multiple blockchains, consider the following table:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th>Blockchain A (Cardano)<\/th><th>Blockchain B (Other)<\/th><th>Description<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Transaction 1<\/td><td>Transaction 4<\/td><td>Both transactions are validated according to their respective blockchain&#8217;s rules and then added to a pool of valid transactions.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transaction 2<\/td><td>Transaction 5<\/td><td>The transactions are included in new blocks by the selected validators or miners of each blockchain.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transaction 3<\/td><td>Transaction 6<\/td><td>Upon inclusion in a block and subsequent blocks, transactions achieve a degree of finality, ensuring their immutability and irreversibility.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, each blockchain has its own set of transactions. The finality of transactions is ensured within each blockchain, but achieving finality across multiple blockchains requires additional mechanisms and protocols.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scalability: Handling Increased Transaction Throughput<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the challenge of handling increased transaction throughput in ADA interoperability, a scalable solution is imperative. Scalability refers to the ability of a blockchain network to handle a growing number of transactions without compromising its performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of cross-chain communication in Cardano, ensuring scalability is crucial to enable seamless and efficient transactions across multiple blockchains.
