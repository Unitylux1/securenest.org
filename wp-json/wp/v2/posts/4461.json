Ready to unravel the intricacies? Let&#8217;s dive right in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Transactions Are Broadcasted<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/learn\/how-ethereum-transactions-work\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Transactions are broadcasted in blockchain networks like Ethereum<\/a> or Bitcoin using a specific process. Here&#8217;s an overview of how transactions are propagated:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>A user initiates a transaction by creating a&nbsp;<strong>digital signature<\/strong>, which validates their ownership and authorization to transfer funds.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The signed transaction is then sent from the user&#8217;s wallet to a node, which acts as their gateway to the blockchain network.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once received by the node, the transaction is validated for correctness and authenticity. This includes verifying the digital signature and checking if the user has sufficient funds.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>After validation, the node adds the transaction to its&nbsp;<strong>local mempool<\/strong>, which is a temporary storage area for pending transactions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Next, the node propagates (broadcasts) the transaction to its connected peers in the network. This is done through a peer-to-peer (P2P) communication process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Each connected peer receives the propagated transaction and performs similar validation checks before adding it to their local mempool.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The process continues as each receiving peer propagates the transaction to its own set of connected peers, creating a ripple effect across the network.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>As more and more nodes receive and validate the transaction, it becomes widely known throughout the blockchain network.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Miners or validators within the network compete to include this newly broadcasted transaction in their upcoming blocks during block creation or mining process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once included in a block and added to the blockchain, the transaction becomes final and cannot be reversed unless there is a&nbsp;<strong>consensus agreement for reversal<\/strong>&nbsp;in specific cases like hard forks or governance decisions.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Different Types of Ethereum Transactions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/learn\/what-is-ethereum\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4082\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum, a popular blockchain platform<\/a>, supports various types of transactions. These transactions serve different purposes and have unique characteristics. Here are some key transaction types on the Ethereum network:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Value Transfer Transactions<\/strong>: These are the most common type of Ethereum transactions. They involve transferring Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, from one address to another.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Contract Deployment Transactions<\/strong>: Ethereum allows users to deploy smart contracts onto the blockchain. Contract deployment transactions are used to create and initialize these self-executing contracts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Contract Function Call Transactions<\/strong>: Once a smart contract is deployed, users can interact with it by invoking its functions through contract function call transactions. These transactions execute specific instructions within the smart contract code.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Token Transfer Transactions<\/strong>: In addition to Ether, Ethereum also supports tokens that adhere to its ERC-20 or ERC-721 token standards. Token transfer transactions enable users to send and receive these tokens between addresses.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Data Transactions<\/strong>: Ethereum&#8217;s flexibility allows for embedding arbitrary data within transactions. Data transactions are used to store information on the blockchain without involving value transfers or interacting with smart contracts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Delegate Call Transactions<\/strong>: Smart contracts can invoke other smart contracts through delegate call transactions. These transactions allow for reusing existing contract logic while maintaining the context of the calling contract.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create2 Deployments<\/strong>: Introduced in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/media.consensys.net\/the-constantinople-hard-fork-what-you-need-to-know-d438a91dec3f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ethereum Constantinople upgrade<\/a>, Create2 deployment allows creating a smart contract at a deterministic address based on predefined parameters.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Payment Channel Transactions<\/strong>: Off-chain scaling solutions like payment channels enable faster and cheaper micropayments on the Ethereum network by conducting multiple off-chain interactions before settling them on-chain via a single transaction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Atomic Swap Transactions<\/strong>: Atomic swaps facilitate trustless peer-to-peer trading between different cryptocurrencies. It involves exchanging digital assets across separate blockchains without requiring intermediary exchanges or escrow services.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Meta Transactions<\/strong>: Meta transactions enable users to perform transactions without directly paying for gas fees using their own Ether. Instead, a relayer pays the gas fees on behalf of the user, allowing for better user experience and onboarding processes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ethereum&#8217;s P2P Network and Transaction Propagation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ethereum blockchain operates on a&nbsp;<strong>peer-to-peer network<\/strong>, where&nbsp;<strong>nodes connect and communicate<\/strong>&nbsp;directly with each other. This&nbsp;<strong>decentralized network<\/strong>&nbsp;is responsible for&nbsp;<strong>propagating transactions<\/strong>&nbsp;throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user initiates a transaction, it is&nbsp;<strong>broadcasted to all connected nodes<\/strong>&nbsp;in the network. These nodes then&nbsp;<strong>validate and propagate the transaction<\/strong>&nbsp;further to their respective peers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum&#8217;s P2P network ensures that transactions are efficiently shared across the entire blockchain, allowing participants to have&nbsp;<strong>consistent and up-to-date information<\/strong>&nbsp;about the&nbsp;<strong>state of the ledger<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ethereum Transaction Commitment Levels<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum Transaction Commitment Levels is a section that explores the different levels of commitment for transactions on the Ethereum network, including latest, safe, and finalized commitments, as well as private transactions and reinforced transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1344\" height=\"896\" src=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/ethereum-transaction-commitment-levels.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/ethereum-transaction-commitment-levels.webp 1344w, https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/ethereum-transaction-commitment-levels-300x200.webp 300w, https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/ethereum-transaction-commitment-levels-1024x683.webp 1024w, https:\/\/securenest.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/ethereum-transaction-commitment-levels-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Latest, Safe, and Finalized Commitments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Latest, Safe, and&nbsp;<strong>Finalized commitments<\/strong>&nbsp;are different levels of&nbsp;<strong>transaction commitment<\/strong>&nbsp;in the blockchain network. These commitment levels determine the status and reliability of transactions within the blockchain. Here&#8217;s what you need to know about each commitment level:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Latest commitments<\/strong>: These are the most recent transactions that have been included in a block but have not yet been confirmed by the&nbsp;<strong>consensus algorithm<\/strong>. While they are visible to participants on the network, they are not considered final and can still be reversed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Safe commitments<\/strong>: Safe commitments refer to transactions that have been included in a block and have received&nbsp;<strong>multiple confirmations<\/strong>&nbsp;from network participants. These confirmations ensure that the transaction is&nbsp;<strong>highly likely to be valid<\/strong>&nbsp;and will not be reversed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Finalized commitments<\/strong>: Finalized commitments represent transactions that have been included in multiple blocks and have a significant number of confirmations from participants across the network. These commitments are considered extremely secure and&nbsp;<strong>virtually impossible to reverse or tamper with<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sending Private Transactions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending private transactions is an important aspect of blockchain technology, allowing users to keep their sensitive information hidden from public view. Here are some key points to understand about sending private transactions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Private transactions in Ethereum<\/strong>: Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, allows for the creation and execution of private transactions. These transactions are designed to be visible only to selected participants, ensuring confidentiality.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benefits of private transactions<\/strong>: Sending private transactions provides several advantages. It allows businesses to protect sensitive information such as trade secrets or financial data. It also enables individuals to keep their personal information confidential while still participating in blockchain networks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>How private transactions work<\/strong>: Private transactions utilize cryptographic techniques such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.pantherprotocol.io\/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">zero-knowledge proofs or ring signatures<\/a>&nbsp;to hide transaction details from public view. Only the intended recipients can decrypt and verify the transaction&#8217;s contents.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Selecting recipients for private transactions<\/strong>: When creating a private transaction, senders have the ability to specify which addresses or participants can access and interact with the transaction. This ensures that only approved individuals can view and process the transaction on the blockchain network.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ensuring privacy on a public blockchain<\/strong>: While public blockchains like Ethereum are transparent by nature, privacy features like encrypted data or confidential contracts enable users to perform private interactions without revealing sensitive information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reinforced Transactions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reinforced transactions are an important concept in transaction propagation within blockchain networks. These transactions are designed to ensure a higher level of trust and security. Here&#8217;s what you need to know:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reinforced transactions undergo&nbsp;<strong>additional validation steps<\/strong>&nbsp;to enhance their reliability and integrity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>These transactions often involve the use of&nbsp;<strong>advanced cryptographic techniques<\/strong>&nbsp;for added security.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>By reinforcing the transaction, blockchain networks can&nbsp;<strong>prevent fraud or tampering attempts<\/strong>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reinforced transactions typically require&nbsp;<strong>more computational resources<\/strong>&nbsp;to process, but this additional effort ensures a higher level of trustworthiness.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In some cases, reinforced transactions may also include&nbsp;<strong>additional metadata or signatures<\/strong>&nbsp;to provide further verification.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The reinforcement process helps&nbsp;<strong>establish consensus<\/strong>&nbsp;among network participants, ensuring that all nodes have a consistent view of the transaction&#8217;s validity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blockchain networks rely on reinforced transactions to maintain the accuracy and integrity of their ledgers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The use of reinforced transactions contributes to the&nbsp;<strong>overall security and resilience<\/strong>&nbsp;of the blockchain network.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blockchain Layers and Architecture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain is comprised of various layers, including the hardware layer, data layer, network layer, consensus layer, and application layer. Each layer is important for the secure and decentralized nature of blockchain technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hardware Layer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardware layer is the&nbsp;<strong>foundation of blockchain technology<\/strong>.

All these devices are interconnected across the globe, supporting a robust decentralized network essential for maintaining ledger integrity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the hardware layer offers insights into how physical resources contribute to building a secure and efficient blockchain system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data Layer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The data layer is another component of blockchain architecture. It acts as the foundation for storing and managing all the transactional data in the blockchain network. Every piece of information, including transactions, smart contracts, and digital assets, is securely stored in this layer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One important feature of the data layer is its immutability. Once a block is added to the blockchain, its data becomes permanent and cannot be altered or tampered with. This ensures that there is an accurate record of all transactions that have occurred on the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key aspect of the data layer is its distributed nature. The blockchain operates on a decentralized network where multiple copies of the ledger are maintained by different nodes or participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This redundancy ensures that even if some nodes go offline or become compromised, the integrity of the data remains intact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The underlying technology used in this layer allows for efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of data. Blockchain networks typically utilize&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/cryptography-techniques-article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cryptographic techniques to ensure security<\/a>&nbsp;while optimizing performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Network Layer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>network layer<\/strong>&nbsp;is a vital component of the blockchain architecture, responsible for&nbsp;<strong>facilitating communication between nodes<\/strong>&nbsp;and ensuring that transactions are propagated throughout the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, allowing for&nbsp;<strong>decentralized transaction propagation<\/strong>. In this layer, nodes connect with each other to exchange information about new transactions and blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This&nbsp;<strong>synchronization process<\/strong>&nbsp;plays a crucial role in&nbsp;<strong>maintaining consensus<\/strong>&nbsp;across the blockchain network. By efficiently propagating transactions, the network layer ensures that all participants have access to the latest updates on the state of the ledger, leading to&nbsp;<strong>increased security and trust within the blockchain ecosystem<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consensus Layer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>consensus layer<\/strong>&nbsp;is a fundamental part of&nbsp;<strong>blockchain architecture<\/strong>&nbsp;that ensures all participants in the network agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through&nbsp;<strong>consensus algorithms<\/strong>, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS), nodes within the network come to a consensus on which transactions should be included in each block. This layer plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain by preventing double-spending and ensuring that only valid transactions are confirmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Application Layer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The application layer is another component of the blockchain architecture as it facilitates the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). This layer enables users to&nbsp;<strong>interact with the blockchain network<\/strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>submitting transactions<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>querying data<\/strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>accessing various services<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts are&nbsp;<strong>self-executing agreements<\/strong>&nbsp;that automatically execute predefined conditions when triggered by specific events, ensuring trust and immutability in transactions. DApps, on the other hand, are&nbsp;<strong>applications built on top of blockchain technology<\/strong>&nbsp;that provide unique functionalities such as decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, voting systems, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging the capabilities of the application layer in blockchain projects, developers can create innovative solutions that revolutionize industries across various sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blockchain Protocol Layers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain protocol layers are essential components of the blockchain architecture, consisting of Layer 0 (L0), Layer 1 (L1), Layer 2 (L2), and Layer 3 (L3), each with its unique functions and responsibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Layer 0 (L0)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Layer 0, also known as L0, is the foundation of the blockchain architecture.
