The public key is used to generate a public address, which is a unique identifier for each user on the <a href=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/learn\/what-is-bitcoin\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitcoin network<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a public address, Bitcoin uses a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cs.purdue.edu\/homes\/hmaji\/teaching\/Fall%202016\/lectures\/16.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hash function to generate a public key hash<\/a>, which is a fixed-length string of letters and numbers derived from the public key.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hash function ensures that the public address is a fixed length and can be easily shared without revealing the user&#8217;s actual public key. The hash function also includes a 4 byte checksum to verify the accuracy of the address.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bitcoin network can verify that a public address is valid by checking the checksum and the public key hash. To send bitcoins, the user signs the transaction with their private key, which is kept secret.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recipient&#8217;s public address is used to receive the bitcoins, and the sender&#8217;s public address is used to verify that the transaction is valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The public key hash is a one-way function, meaning that it is practically impossible to reverse the process and derive the original public key from the hash. This means that the public key hash can be shared with others without revealing the actual public key.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that if someone gains access to the public key hash, they cannot easily derive the public key and use it to spend the bitcoins. Furthermore, the use of public key hashes also helps prevent errors when entering bitcoin addresses manually.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin public keys are long and complex, consisting of 64 alphanumeric characters. By using a hash of the public key, the length of the bitcoin address is reduced to a manageable size, and errors are less likely to occur.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/securenest.org\/learn\/bitcoin-address-compressed-uncompressed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">address can be seen as a compressed public key version<\/a>. Additionally, the public key hash is checked using a checksum, which helps detect typos or other errors when entering the bitcoin address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Do We Need Public and Private Keys for Blockchain?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Public and private keys are crucial components of blockchain technology.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of cryptography ensures the security of transactions and data in a decentralized network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public keys are used to receive transactions, while private keys are used to sign and authorize them. Here are some reasons why we need public and private keys for blockchain:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Security:<\/strong><br>Public and private keys ensure the security of transactions and protect them from unauthorized access and fraud.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Decentralization:<\/strong><br>Public and private keys enable the blockchain to operate in a decentralized network without the need for intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Privacy:<\/strong><br>Public and private keys allow users to keep their identity anonymous and secure.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Encryption:<\/strong><br>Public and private keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Verification:<\/strong><br>Public keys allow other users on the network to <a href=\"https:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/glossary\/term\/public_key\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">verify the authenticity of a transaction<\/a>, while private keys ensure that only the rightful owner can authorize the transaction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Efficiency:<\/strong><br>Public and private keys make blockchain transactions fast and efficient by eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs.<br><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Public and private keys are essential components of blockchain technology that ensure the security, decentralization, and privacy of transactions while making them efficient and verifiable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is a Digital Signature?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisa.gov\/news-events\/news\/understanding-digital-signatures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">verify the authenticity and integrity<\/a> of digital documents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a mathematical function that generates a unique string of alphanumeric characters, also known as a hash.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hash is then encrypted using the private key of the sender. It can only be decrypted using the corresponding public key of the sender.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a recipient receives the message, they can use the sender&#8217;s public key to decrypt the digital signature and verify its authenticity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital signatures are used to sign transactions in the Bitcoin protocol, as every transaction is signed with the sender&#8217;s private key. This ensures that only the owner of the private key can initiate transactions and spend their funds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital signatures are also used to prove ownership of a particular account or asset. One example of a digital signature algorithm is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This algorithm uses elliptic curve multiplication to generate the public and private keys, which are then used to sign and verify transactions. Digital signatures are an important tool for ensuring the security and authenticity of transactions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They provide a secure and efficient way to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that messages have not been tampered with or altered in transit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Elliptic Curve Cryptography <a href=\"https:\/\/courses.engr.illinois.edu\/cs461\/fa2009\/slides\/461.9%20PK%20Cryptography.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(ECC) is a form of public key cryptography<\/a> that is widely used in various fields, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It offers several advantages over traditional public key cryptography systems, such as RSA, including smaller key sizes and faster computation times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ECC is based on the mathematical properties of elliptic curves, which are algebraic curves defined by cubic equations. In ECC, users generate a pair of keys: a private key and a public key. The private key is kept secret, while the public key is shared with others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The public key is generated by performing elliptic curve multiplication on a fixed point on the curve and the private key.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ECC can be used to sign and encrypt data, such as Bitcoin transactions, by using a cryptographic hash function to convert the data into a fixed-size hash and then using the private key to sign the hash.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The signature can be verified by anyone who has access to the public key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How a Cryptocurrency Wallet Transaction Works?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a cryptocurrency transaction occurs, the digital currency is transferred from one wallet to another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cryptocurrency wallet transaction works in the following way:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>User creates a transaction:<\/strong><br>The user creates a transaction by specifying the amount of cryptocurrency they want to send and the recipient&#8217;s public key.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Transaction broadcast:<\/strong><br>The user broadcasts the transaction to the network.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Verification:<\/strong><br>The transaction is verified by the network nodes, which confirm that the user has enough cryptocurrency in their wallet to complete the transaction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mining:<\/strong><br>The transaction is added to the blockchain through mining. The miner solves a complex mathematical problem to validate the transaction and add it to the blockchain.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Confirmation:<\/strong><br>The transaction is confirmed once it is added to the blockchain. The transaction details are then recorded and cannot be altered.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Funds transferred:<\/strong><br>Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds are transferred from the user&#8217;s wallet to the recipient&#8217;s wallet.<br><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency transactions are secure because they use public key cryptography and hash algorithms which are advanced encryption techniques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can send funds to anyone with a cryptocurrency wallet, and the transaction details are recorded on a public ledger. Transactions can also be made anonymously by using private wallets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>FAQ<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Many Times the Public Key is Hashed to Create a Bitcoin Address?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Bitcoin, the public key is hashed twice using SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hash algorithms to create a Bitcoin address.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resulting hash is then encoded to form the final Bitcoin address.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process is used to generate a unique address that can receive funds and is used in Bitcoin transactions. By hashing the public key twice, it adds an extra layer of security to the process of creating a Bitcoin address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Do We Need Addresses and Just Not Send Bitcoin to Public Keys?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin addresses provide a convenient way for users to receive payments without having to share their public keys.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of addresses also adds an additional layer of security, as the public key used to create the address can be changed without affecting the address itself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes it more difficult for hackers to intercept transactions and steal bitcoins. Additionally, addresses are easier to remember and share than long strings of public keys.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the use of addresses is an important part of the Bitcoin protocol that helps to ensure the security and convenience of transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why is Bitcoin Double Hashed?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin uses a double hash to increase the security of the network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hash functions are used to create a digital fingerprint of a block of data, such as a Bitcoin transaction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first hash function used in Bitcoin is the SHA-256, which <a href=\"https:\/\/classes.cs.uchicago.edu\/archive\/2018\/fall\/23200-1\/06.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creates a unique fixed-length output<\/a> for each input. The second hash function used in Bitcoin is the RIPEMD-160, which creates a shorter output than SHA-256.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By double hashing, Bitcoin makes it more difficult for someone to create a fraudulent transaction or to tamper with the blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Double hashing ensures that the output of a hash function is used as the input of another hash function, which makes it more difficult for a hacker to reverse engineer the original input data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Does Bitcoin Use SHA256?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin uses the SHA256 hashing algorithm because it&#8217;s secure and fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SHA256 algorithm is a one-way cryptographic function that takes input data and produces a fixed-size output that can&#8217;t be reversed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin uses SHA256 to secure and verify transactions by creating a digital signature. SHA256 is widely used in many applications that require data security, and it&#8217;s also used in the creation of digital signatures.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SHA256 algorithm has proven to be a reliable method for securing data, which is essential in the world of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin uses SHA256 in combination with other cryptographic functions to create a secure and decentralized system that can&#8217;t be easily hacked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong>: Why Does Bitcoin Hash the Public Key?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, cryptocurrencies are a complex but fascinating technology that has transformed the way we think about money and transactions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology and Public-Key cryptography work together to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent network that enables anyone to send and receive funds without intermediaries.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The reason why Bitcoin hashes the public key to an address is because they are shorter and more secure.
