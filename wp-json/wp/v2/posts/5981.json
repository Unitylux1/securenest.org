Traders often decide to switch to different platforms because of the higher fees. The commission fees on Coinmama range from 0.99% to 3.90%, depending on how much you spend within a 90-day period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison, Coinbase, another popular exchange, has lower fees for credit card purchases, estimated to be around 4%. It&#8217;s important to consider these fees when choosing an exchange for your cryptocurrency transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limited selection of cryptocurrencies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinmama offers a range of 16 different cryptocurrencies that you can buy. However, it is important to note that Coinmama only sells Bitcoin. This means that if you are interested in buying other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Litecoin, you will need to use another platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to some other exchanges, the selection of cryptocurrencies available on Coinmama may be somewhat limited. It&#8217;s always a good idea to check the list of supported cryptocurrencies before deciding to use any exchange platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Verification process may be time-consuming<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The verification process on Coinmama could take up to around 30 minutes. During this process, you will need to provide proof of identification. Coinmama typically verifies accounts within a few hours, but it may take longer during busy times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before making a purchase, you must pass one of three verification steps. This involves giving a valid government-issued ID, taking a selfie with the ID, and including a note. It&#8217;s important to remember that while the verification process may take some time, it is necessary for security purposes and to ensure the safety of your transactions on Coinmama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lack of advanced trading features<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinmama is a popular cryptocurrency exchange, but it has a drawback when it comes to advanced trading features. This means that if you&#8217;re an experienced trader looking for more advanced tools and options, Coinmama may not be the best platform for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reviews, some traders prefer other platforms because they offer more advanced trading features. While Coinmama focuses on providing excellent customer support and ease of use, it lacks the more sophisticated features that experienced traders often rely on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re someone who needs those advanced trading features, you might want to consider other options instead of Coinmama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safety and Legitimacy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Is Coinmama safe to use?
