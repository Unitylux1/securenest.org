If you\u2019re just starting out, it\u2019s recommended to use a custodial account provided by an exchange that supports minors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve chosen an exchange with age restrictions that fit within your range, setting up an account typically requires providing basic information such as name, email address, date of birth and creating login credentials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After verifying your identity and age (depending on the platform regulations), adding funds to your account is simple using options such as debit cards or bank transfers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Verify Identity and Age<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To comply with legal regulations and avoid any potential issues, it is important to verify your identity and age before buying crypto under 18. Here are the steps to follow:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Choose a reputable exchange or platform that allows minors to invest in cryptocurrency. Exchanges won\u2019t allow minors to open accounts. Your two alternatives are P2P-exchanges or letting your parents buy crypto for you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create an account by providing your basic personal information, such as name, address, and email.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Verify your account by submitting a valid form of identification, such as a driver\u2019s license or passport.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some platforms may also require additional documentation to verify your age, such as a birth certificate, social security number or student ID.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once your identity and age are verified, you can add funds to your account and start investing in cryptocurrency.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that failing to verify your identity and age can cause legal consequences and potentially loss of investment. Make sure you follow the guidelines set by the platform or exchange you choose for buying crypto under 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add Funds to the Account<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have set up your wallet and account, the next step is to add funds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various payment methods available, such as deposit verification or manually linking a bank account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some exchanges may also accept debit cards for purchasing cryptocurrency directly. It\u2019s important to ensure that the payment method you choose is secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to keep in mind when adding funds is the risk of scams associated with buying cryptocurrency.
