Copyright infringement is a serious concern in the NFT space, so conduct due diligence and verify the authenticity and ownership of the artwork.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Regulations:<\/strong> NFTs are typically bought and sold using cryptocurrencies on blockchain platforms. Stay informed about the evolving regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to ensure compliance with any legal requirements.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Risks:<\/strong> DeFi platforms allow users to lend, borrow, and trade NFTs.
