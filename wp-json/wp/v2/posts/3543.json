With&nbsp;<strong>over 10,000 digital assets available<\/strong>&nbsp;for buying and selling, Coinbase offers one of the widest ranges in the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re interested in&nbsp;<strong>popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, or Litecoin<\/strong>, or more&nbsp;<strong>niche altcoins<\/strong>, chances are you&#8217;ll find them on Coinbase. This wide variety allows users to diversify their crypto holdings and explore different investment opportunities all within one platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being the&nbsp;<strong>largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange<\/strong>&nbsp;also gives Coinbase an advantage when it comes to currency options for U.S. residents.
