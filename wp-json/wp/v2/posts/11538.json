This can signal a potential reversal in the price trend. Pay attention to divergences between volume and price action as they can provide valuable insights into the market sentiment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building a Technical Analysis Checklist for Binance Coin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure success in your Binance Coin (BNB) swing trading endeavors, it&#8217;s essential to create a comprehensive technical analysis checklist.
