Then it requests block inventories from peers to identify the blocks it needs to download to complete the chain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The node downloads the blocks from multiple peers to optimize bandwidth usage and minimize the risk of getting stuck on a bad peer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin Core also implements checkpoints to optimize synchronization and prevent attackers from creating a fork of the chain. The synchronization process can take a while, especially for new nodes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Synchronization can stall if the node\u2019s internet connection is slow or if it encounters orphan blocks or forks of the chain. In such cases, the node may need to disconnect from peers, restart the sync, or even use the \u2018reindex\u2019 option to rescan the disk for block data.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Litecoin and Ethereum also use similar synchronization methods to sync their nodes with their respective blockchains. Bitcoin Core synchronization can also help users optimize privacy-preserving techniques by avoiding downloading useless data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Does the Initial Block Download Work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial block download (IBD) is downloading and verifying all the blocks in the block chain, starting from the genesis block.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process is crucial for new nodes joining the network or nodes that have been offline for a long time. Here are the key steps involved in the IBD process:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Download Headers:<\/strong><br>The <a href=\"https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/mas-s62-cryptocurrency-engineering-and-design-spring-2018\/853e62690b0eabb43583ca201a3641f9_mhQebe1Y4d0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first step is to download all the block headers<\/a> for the entire block chain. This process is known as headers sync. These headers contain metadata for each block, such as the block\u2019s hash, timestamp, and difficulty.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Verify Headers:<\/strong><br>After downloading the headers, the node verifies the validity of each header. The node checks if the hash of each header matches its contents, and if it follows the difficulty rules of the network.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Download Blocks:<\/strong><br>Once all the headers have been validated, the node downloads blocks from the network. The node requests blocks that are part of the best chain from its peers using the peer-to-peer (p2p) network.<br>The node verifies the contents of each block, including the transactions included in the block.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Serialization:<\/strong><br>Before a block is added to the node\u2019s local copy of the block chain, it is serialized into a format that can be stored on a disk. The serialization process converts the block into a series of bytes that can be written to disk.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Verification:<\/strong><br>After a block has been added to the block chain, the node verifies the block\u2019s validity. The node checks if the block follows the rules of the network, such as the maximum block size and the validity of each transaction in the block.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Privacy Preserving:<\/strong><br>To protect the privacy of the node\u2019s user, the node\u2019s wallet address is not associated with the node\u2019s IP address.<br><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The IBD process can take a long time to complete, depending on the size of the block chain and the node\u2019s internet speed. However, once the IBD process is complete, the node can take part in the network and help validate transactions and mine new blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Blocks-First and Headers-First<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks-first and headers-first refer to two different approaches to downloading and syncing blocks in the Bitcoin network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In blocks-first syncing, the node downloads all the blocks in the blockchain, and then validates them to ensure their accuracy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach can be time-consuming and bandwidth-intensive, especially for new nodes joining the network. In contrast, headers-first syncing involves downloading only <a href=\"https:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/glossary\/term\/block_header\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the block headers<\/a> initially and then validating them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows the node to verify the authenticity of the headers and determine the last block that was accepted by the network. After this, the node can selectively download only the blocks required to get up to date with the network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is faster and more efficient than blocks-first syncing. However, the headers-first approach is vulnerable to an attack where a malicious miner creates a chain of fake headers that leads to a fork in the chain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the 128 blocks checkpoint comes in, which contains inventories for blocks 1 to 128, and it is verified to ensure the validity of the chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Can You Connect to the Blockchain by Skipping the Sync?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it is not possible to connect to the blockchain by skipping the sync process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a new node joins the network, it needs to synchronize its copy of the blockchain with the rest of the network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means downloading and validating all the blocks and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.osti.gov\/servlets\/purl\/1640052\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transactions from the genesis block to the latest block<\/a>. This is a crucial step in ensuring the integrity and security of the network, and skipping it can lead to serious issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sync process ensures that the new node has the same copy of the blockchain as the rest of the network, and any attempt to bypass it would cause a node that is out of sync with the rest of the network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sync process is essential for a node to take part in mining or verifying transactions, so any attempt to connect to the network without syncing would be futile.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the initial sync can take some time, it is a necessary step to ensure the safety and reliability of the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Check the Block Height of a Transaction?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To check the block height of a transaction, you need to first identify the transaction ID (TXID) of the transaction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then use a blockchain explorer to search for the TXID and locate the block in which it was included.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/developers\/docs\/data-and-analytics\/block-explorers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">block information will typically include the block height<\/a>, which is the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain before the block that contains the transaction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you are running a full node or a sync node, you can use a command-line interface to query the node for the block height. This involves opening a command prompt and running a command that requests the node to return the block height.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have the block height, you can use it to track the confirmations of the transaction. Confirmations refer to the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain after the block that includes the transaction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more confirmations a transaction has, the more secure and irreversible it becomes. Checking the block height of a transaction is important to ensure that it has been added to the blockchain and to track its confirmation status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Troubleshoot if Your Qt Wallet is Not Syncing?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Qt wallet is not syncing, there are a few troubleshooting steps you can take.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, make sure that you are using the latest version of the wallet software, as outdated software can cause syncing issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using the latest version, try restarting the wallet and your computer to see if that helps. You can also check to see if your network connection is stable, as a weak connection can interfere with syncing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is to try connecting to a different node, as the node you are currently connected to may experience issues. You can also check the debug logs to see if there are any error messages that can give you more insight into the syncing issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If none of these steps help, you can reach out to the developer community for help or look for online forums where other users have experienced similar issues and found solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that syncing can take some time, especially if there are many blocks to download, so be patient and give the process time to complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">FAQ<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Does Bitcoin Core Node Mine?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, Bitcoin Core node does not mine anymore.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is merely a software implementation of a full node, which validates transactions and blocks on the Bitcoin network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could mine with CPU in the past, but this was abandoned because of introducing ASIC miners.
